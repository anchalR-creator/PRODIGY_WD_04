   The creativity and interactivity of websites online sparked my curiosity — and I was eager to build something of my own. I enjoy working on glowing-themed web pages and experimenting with visually engaging layouts, features like clipboards, and modern styling. Front-end development feels like a natural fit for me, as it allows me to blend both creativity and code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Along the way, I've faced challenges like debugging complex errors and fixing tricky layout issues — but each hurdle has made me more confident and capable. I get excited by the idea of building professional websites, especially those for businesses or individuals who want their digital presence to stand out.

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
    I’m currently a BCA student at Presidency University, Bangalore. My passion for coding began during my PUC at Christ Junior College, where I was introduced to programming and web development in 11th and 12th grade.

      <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
      <p>
    As a student developer, I’ve built a strong foundation in front-end development through personal projects and continuous self-learning.
    While I’m still gaining formal industry experience, I’ve developed skills that go beyond coding — like creative thinking, problem-solving, and adapting quickly to new technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
    My peers and teachers often recognize me for my leadership abilities, patience, and openness to learning.
    Whether it’s collaborating on academic projects or helping others debug, I strive to bring a thoughtful and positive approach to every task.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm currently exploring opportunities to apply my skills in real-world settings, such as internships and freelance projects, to continue growing as a web developer and team contributor.
